The Peninsula, a new affordable housing project in Hunts Point, will soon begin accepting applications via <a href="https://housingconnect.nyc.gov/PublicWeb/"> Housing Connect</a>, the city’s affordable housing portal. According to MHANY Management, the developer, 183 units are nearly complete.
       </p>

<h2> Who qualifies for apartment units at The Peninsula?</h2>
<p>
	 Of  the 183 new units, the majority (110 units) are for people earning between 51 and 80% of the city’s area median income. Another 54 units are for people earning less than 50% of the median income, and 18 units are set aside for the formerly homeless.  Thanks to the Koch-era “community preference” policy, half of the building’s apartments are reserved for residents of Bronx Community District 2, but local applicants must still meet the income requirements.
			</p>
<p>
				Most Hunts Point residents will be eligible only for a small subset  of the new apartments. The median income in Hunts  Point and Mott Haven was $26,033  in 2019, according to <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=Income%20and%20Poverty&g=7950000US3603701,3603702,3603703,3603704,3603705,3603706,3603707,3603708,3603709,3603710,3603801,3603802,3603803,3603804,3603805,3603806,3603807,3603808,3603809,3603810,3603901,3603902,3603903,3604001,3604002,3604003,3604004,3604005,3604006,3604007,3604008,3604009,3604010,3604011,3604012,3604013,3604014,3604015,3604016,3604017,3604018,3604101,3604102,3604103,3604104,3604105,3604106,3604107,3604108,3604109,3604110,3604111,3604112,3604113,3604114&tid=ACSST5Y2019.S1901&hidePreview=true">census data</a> —  which, for a family of three, is about 24% of the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/area-median-income.page">area median income</a>.  Such a family, if not homeless, would only be eligible for 18 out of the 183 new apartment units at The Peninsula.

      “We are always working to improve access to lowest income individuals and families…The balance between available public resources and affordability continues to be the ongoing/never ending discussion and we are doing our best to maintain this balance and push for more resources,” said Ismene Speliotis, MHANY’s executive director.

<h2>How does The Peninsula compare to other new affordable housing across the city?</h2>

<iframe title="City-Wide Affordable Housing, By Income Groups" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-6k5a1" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6k5a1/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="541"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

<p>Compared to the rest of the city, The Peninsula has more units available for the poorest groups.
</p>		
			<p>

  Under Mayor DeBlasio’s Housing New York Plan, the city has created 105,935 new affordable housing units since 2014.  The city subsidizes housing for a broad range of income bands — from 0% all the way to 165% of area median income. However, across the city, just 17.2% of new units are for those with extremely low incomes -- i.e. people making less than 30% of the area median income. That is less than the proportion of units that have been built for people making 80% or more of area median income -- 19.2%.

<p>
The following map shows where new affordable housing for the poorest people is concentrated.  In Hunts Point, just 17.2% of new affordable units are for extremely low income groups. In Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, the figure is nearly 100%.

</script>

<p>
The city has created more affordable housing for people making more than 80% of area median income than it has for people making less than 30% of area median income. The next map shows where affordable housing for moderate and middle-income households outnumbers affordable housing for extremely low income households.  Blue indicates more affordable housing units for those making more than 80% AMI than for those making less than 30% AMI. Red indicates more affordable housing units for those making less than 30% AMI than for those making more than 80% AMI.
